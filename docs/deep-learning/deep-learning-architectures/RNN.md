RNN stands for Recurrent Neural Network, which is a type of deep learning neural network architecture that is designed for processing sequential data, such as time series data, text data, speech data, and more. RNNs have a unique ability to maintain and update an internal hidden state, allowing them to capture temporal dependencies and contextual information from the input data.

The key components of a typical RNN architecture are:

1. Recurrent layers: These layers have recurrent connections that allow information to flow from one time step to another in a sequential manner. The hidden state of the recurrent layer is updated at each time step, allowing the RNN to capture sequential patterns and dependencies. Common types of recurrent layers include SimpleRNN, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit).

2. Input data: RNNs take sequential data as input, such as time series data or sequences of words in a text. The input data is typically represented as vectors or sequences of embeddings, which are learned representations of the input data.

3. Activation functions: These functions introduce non-linearity into the RNN architecture, allowing the model to learn complex non-linear relationships between sequential input data and their corresponding hidden states. Common activation functions used in RNNs include ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh.

4. Fully connected layers: These layers are traditional artificial neural network layers, where each neuron is connected to every neuron in the previous and subsequent layers. Fully connected layers can be added after the recurrent layers to make the final classification or regression predictions.

5. Loss functions: These functions measure the error between the predicted outputs and the ground truth labels during training. Common loss functions used in RNNs include cross-entropy for classification tasks and mean squared error (MSE) for regression tasks.

6. Optimization algorithms: These algorithms are used to update the weights and biases of the RNN during training, with the aim of minimizing the loss function. Common optimization algorithms used in RNNs include stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop.

Here is a simple example of an RNN architecture in Python using the Keras library:

```python
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import SimpleRNN, Dense

# Define RNN architecture
model = Sequential()
model.add(SimpleRNN(32, input_shape=(10, 1)))  # 10 time steps, 1 feature
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

In this example, the RNN architecture consists of a SimpleRNN layer with 32 hidden units, followed by a fully connected layer with a sigmoid activation function for binary classification. The model is then compiled with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function for training.
