Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs or ConvNets) are a type of deep learning neural network architecture that are particularly well-suited for image processing tasks, such as image classification, object detection, and image generation. CNNs are designed to automatically learn features from images through convolutional layers, and are capable of capturing spatial hierarchies and patterns in images.

The key components of a typical CNN architecture are:

- **Convolutional layers :** These layers apply convolution operations to input images using filters (also known as kernels) to extract local patterns or features, such as edges, corners, and textures. The output of these operations are feature maps, which represent the learned features in the input images.

- **Pooling layers :** These layers downsample the feature maps obtained from the convolutional layers, reducing the spatial dimensions of the feature maps while preserving the important features. Common pooling operations include max pooling and average pooling.

-   **Activation functions :** These functions introduce non-linearity into the CNN architecture, allowing the model to learn complex non-linear relationships between input images and their corresponding features. Common activation functions used in CNNs include ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), sigmoid, and tanh.

-   **Fully connected layers :** These layers are traditional artificial neural network layers, where each neuron is connected to every neuron in the previous and subsequent layers. Fully connected layers are typically used in the final layers of a CNN to make the final classification or regression predictions.

- **Loss functions :** These functions measure the error between the predicted outputs and the ground truth labels during training. Common loss functions used in CNNs include cross-entropy for classification tasks and mean squared error (MSE) for regression tasks.

- **Optimization algorithms :** These algorithms are used to update the weights and biases of the CNN during training, with the aim of minimizing the loss function. Common optimization algorithms used in CNNs include stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop.

Here is a simple example of a CNN architecture in Python using the Keras library:

```python
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

# Define CNN architecture
model = Sequential()
model.add(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(64, 64, 3)))
model.add(MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
model.add(Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
model.add(MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax'))

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

In this example, the CNN architecture consists of convolutional layers with ReLU activation, max pooling layers for downsampling, and fully connected layers with softmax activation for classification. The model is then compiled with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function for training.
