Git and GitHub for Version Control

## Course Overview
This course will introduce students to Git and GitHub, two essential tools for version control in software development. Students will learn how to use Git to track changes in code and collaborate with others, as well as how to use GitHub to store, share, and manage code repositories.

## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Understand the basics of version control and why it's important in software development
- Install Git and configure it for use on their local machine
- Use Git to track changes in code, including creating commits, branching, merging, and resolving conflicts
- Collaborate with others using Git, including pulling and pushing changes to remote repositories
- Understand the basics of GitHub and how to use it to manage code repositories
- Create and manage repositories on GitHub, including using issues, pull requests, and code reviews to collaborate with others
- Understand best practices for using Git and GitHub in a team environment
